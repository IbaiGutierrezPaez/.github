## RoboRescue UMA | University of MÃ¡laga

**RoboRescue UMA is a robotics team with the aim of building a robot for participating in the RoboCup Rescue Robot League.**

Our team is comprised of students with all sorts of abilities. Being part of this group is an enriching experience for all the members that can learn different skills from their peers and contribute to an exciting project in which knowledge from several fields is required. Electronics, programming, communication protocols, 3D modeling and printing are some examples. However, nothing is more crucial than working as a team and helping each other to overcome the challenges that show up everyday. On this website, we would like to share with you the results of our long but enjoyable journey.
